# AI Instructions

# AI Instructions for TypeScript Files

# This file contains instructions for AI models to follow when processing TypeScript files.

# The instructions are designed to ensure that the AI understands the context and requirements for TypeScript code.

# The AI should follow these instructions to generate, modify, or analyze TypeScript code effectively.

# 1. Understand TypeScript Syntax

# The AI should be familiar with TypeScript syntax, including types, interfaces, classes, and modules.

# 2. Maintain Type Safety

# The AI should ensure that all TypeScript code maintains type safety, using appropriate types and interfaces.

# 3. Use Modern TypeScript Features

# The AI should utilize modern TypeScript features such as async/await, generics, and type inference where applicable.

# 4. Follow Best Practices

# The AI should adhere to TypeScript best practices, including proper naming conventions, code organization, and documentation.

# 5. Provide Clear Comments

# The AI should include clear and concise comments in the code to explain complex logic or important decisions.

# 6. Optimize for Readability

# The AI should write code that is easy to read and understand, avoiding unnecessary complexity.

# 7. Handle Errors Gracefully

# The AI should implement error handling in a way that is consistent with TypeScript's type system.

# 8. Use Type Definitions

# The AI should leverage type definitions from libraries and frameworks to ensure compatibility and type safety.

# 9. Test Code Thoroughly

# The AI should ensure that all TypeScript code is thoroughly tested, using appropriate testing frameworks and methodologies.

# 10. Keep Up with TypeScript Updates

# The AI should stay informed about the latest TypeScript updates and features to ensure that the code is up-to-date.

# 11. Use Linting and Formatting Tools

# The AI should utilize linting and formatting tools to maintain code quality and consistency.

# 12. Be Mindful of Performance

# The AI should consider performance implications of the code, optimizing where necessary without sacrificing readability.

# 13. Follow Project Conventions

# The AI should adhere to any specific project conventions or guidelines that are in place for TypeScript development.

# 14. Collaborate with Other Developers

# The AI should be able to generate code that is compatible with other developers' work and can easily integrate with existing codebases.

# 15. Provide Examples

# The AI should provide examples of how to use the generated TypeScript code, including usage scenarios and expected outcomes.

# 16. Be Open to Feedback

# The AI should be receptive to feedback and willing to make adjustments based on user input or project requirements.

# 17. Document Code

# The AI should ensure that all TypeScript code is well-documented, including function signatures, parameters, and return types.

# 18. Use Descriptive Variable Names

# The AI should use descriptive variable names that clearly indicate their purpose and type.

# 19. Avoid Global Variables

# The AI should avoid using global variables to prevent conflicts and maintain modularity in the code.

# 20. Ensure Compatibility

# The AI should ensure that the generated TypeScript code is compatible with the target environment, whether it's Node.js, browsers, or other platforms.

# 21. Use TypeScript Configuration

# The AI should utilize a TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.json`) to manage compiler options and project settings.

# 22. Implement Dependency Management

# The AI should manage dependencies effectively, using package managers like npm or yarn to handle TypeScript libraries and frameworks.

# 23. Reference Screeps Documentation

# The AI should reference the Screeps documentation (https://docs.screeps.com/api) for any specific APIs or features related to Screeps development.
